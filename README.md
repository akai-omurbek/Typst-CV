# Welcome to my Typst based CV page

Hi, everyone! This is my take on a reproducible CV powered by Typst. This one is very, ***very*** raw. I have to work on it a bit more in the future. The layout is optimal for one page (the main / sidebar separation) - otherwise it might look shabby. [Click here](cv.pdf) to see what it looks like.

## Usage 

1. Get my repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/akai-omurbek/Typst-CV
cd Typst-CV 
```
2. Change the YAML file `cv_info.yml` - that one is pretty straightforward
3. Compile your CV:
```sh
typst compile cv.typ
```
